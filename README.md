This is something my dad and I worked on together -- a virtual loom. My dad is into woodworking and other crafts, and he made is own loom years ago -- a big contraption as I remember. A long time ago he wrote a program in BASIC to model what a loom does, when given various inputs about the color and configuration of yarn to produce a desired fabric pattern. We were trying to re-create this, as his original program is long gone. He had tried playing around with [SmallBasic](https://smallbasic-publicwebsite.azurewebsites.net), but didn't get very far. I wanted to do it in C# of course as a WinForms app, since that's what I know.

A big challenge here is that I don't understand looms. My dad understands them deeply, but mainly in a *mechanical* way, not *algorithmically.* He kept using weaving jargon like harness and heddle, warp and weft, and I got particularly tripped up on concepts like "raising" and "lowering" harnesses. I maybe could've tried to learn about looms and weaving to get a hands-on feel for it, but we had only few hours. My dad does have a deep background in SQL and database design in fact, but finding a workable language on the programmatic or algotrithmic behavior of looms was pretty elusive at first. In fact, we'd made an attempt at this very app a year ago in this [repo](https://github.com/adamosoftware/Loom). This didn't work out because I never did understand how a loom works, and ended up approaching weaving as a [repeating stamp pattern](https://github.com/adamosoftware/Loom/blob/master/Loom/Stamp.cs). But this didn't work as a *weaving model*, which is what my dad was after.
